[Developer Roadmap](https://www.techroadmap.xyz) is a free online resource on
careers in the tech industry. Anyone who wants to break or transition into the
tech industry or has already broken into it can use these resources to choose
and define their career path and learn about the skills needed to build
themselves in the chosen career.

## Getting Started

Getting started is easy. Our [website](https://www.techroadmap.xyz) is easy to
navigate with simplicity but quality as part of our goals.

But if you would like to fork the repository instead either for personal
learning or to contribute to the project, then please follow the steps below:

_Note: For contributing to this repo, please read our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Timonwa/techroadmap/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
and
[Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/Timonwa/techroadmap/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
before making any contributions._

### Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button at the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

### Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open
the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to
clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```git
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "URL you just copied" (without quotation marks) is the URL to this
repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the
URL.

For example:

```git
git clone https://github.com/your-username/techroadmap.git
```

where `your-username` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents
of the Developer Roadmap repository on GitHub to your computer.

### Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already
there):

```git
cd techroadmap
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```git
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```git
git checkout -b addDesignRoadmap
```

_Note: Let the name of the branch be descriptive of the changes you are about to
make._

### Run the React app

First of all, install all the dependencies needed to run the react app on your
system successfully by using the command `yarn`:

```git
yarn
```

After that, run the command `yarn dev` to view the app and any changes you might
make in your browser.

```git
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.

### Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now go ahead and make the necessary contributions you want to make.

You can execute the command `git status`, to see the files you have made the
changes to.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add .` command:

```git
git add .
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```git
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message on the changes you made."
```

_Note: Ensure that there are no warnings or errors in your console before making
any commits and pull requests._

### Push changes to GitHub

Please before you push your codes to the repository make sure you pull from the
repository, so the recent changes that have been made to the main repo can be
reflected on your local machine. This is to avoid merge conflicts. Use the git
command line `git pull origin main`

```
git pull origin main
```

and fix any merge conflicts you might have before pushing your changes.

Now push your changes using the command `git push`:

```git
git push origin your-new-branch-name
```

replacing `your-new-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created
earlier.

### Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & Pull Request`
button. Click on that button.

Now submit the pull request.

Your changes or contributions will be reviewed and if ok, merged into the main
branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have
been merged.
