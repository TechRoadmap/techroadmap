# Tech Roadmap

‚≠ê Please click the star above on our repo, it keeps me motivated. You can also follow TechRoadmap on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/techroadmap__).üôÇ

[Tech Roadmap](https://techroadmap.netlify.app) is a free online resource on careers in the tech industry. 
Anyone who wants to break or transition into the tech industry or has already broken into it, 
can use these resources to choose and define their career path and learn about the skills needed to build themselves in the chosen career.

## About The Project
Tech Roadmap lets you have access to collections of ebooks, videos, articles, guides, etc on different careers in the tech industry including the no-code jobs. 
So if you are looking for resources either for yourself or someone else about the beginning and growing a tech career, then Tech Roadmap is definitely the place to start.

The roadmaps or step-by-step guides are carefully curated for the different Tech Careers listed on our websites. And the collections of resources are carefully arranged so that the learner has a guided learning path.

<!-- You can read more about what inspired Tech Roadmap in my [article](https://blog.timonwa.com/tech-roadmap-everything-you-need-to-help-you-choose-and-learn-a-career-in-tech). -->

## Project Status
Tech Roadmap is live with the first roadmap created ([Frontend Development Roadmap](https://techroadmap.netlify.app/html/careers/frontend.html)).

I am working on adding more quality roadmaps on other Tech Careers. Anticipate! üòÅ

The project is currently built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Soon all data will be removed from the html pages and placed into corresponding Json files to have cleaner html documents.

Readmes will also be created for each roadmap so that one can also have copies of the resources on GitHub by forking the repository.
 
It will also be migrated to the React Framework in the later future.

## Getting Started
Getting started is easy. Our [website](https://techroadmap.netlify.app) is easy to navigate with simplicity but quality as part of our goals.

But if you would like to fork the repository instead either for personal learning or contributing to the project, then please follow the steps below:

*Note: For contributing to this repo, please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Timonwa/techroadmap/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/Timonwa/techroadmap/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making any contributions.*

### Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

### Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/techroadmap.git
```

where `your-username` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

### Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd techroadmap
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b addDesignRoadmap
```

(Please let the name of the branch be descriptive of the changes you are about to make.)

### Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now go ahead and make the necessary contributions you want to make.

You can execute the command `git status`, to see the files you have made the changes to.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add .` command:

```
git add .
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message on the changes you made."
```

### Push changes to GitHub

Please before you push your codes to the repository make sure you pull from the repository, so the recent changes that have been made to the main repo can be reflected on your local machine. This is to avoid merge conflicts. Use the git command line `git pull upstream main`

```
git pull upstream main
```

and fix any merge conflicts you might have before pushing your changes.

Now push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin your-new-branch-name
```

replacing `your-new-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

### Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

Now submit the pull request.

Your changes or contributions will be reviewed and if ok, merged into the main branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
